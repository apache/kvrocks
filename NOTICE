For the library lz4(https://github.com/lz4/lz4):

LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed > 500 MB/s per core, scalable with multi-cores CPU.
We only used the source code in `lib` directory which is under the BSD 2-Clause:

    This repository uses 2 different licenses :
    - all files in the `lib` directory use a BSD 2-Clause license
    - all other files use a GPLv2 license, unless explicitly stated otherwise

    Relevant license is reminded at the top of each source file,
    and with presence of COPYING or LICENSE file in associated directories.

    This model is selected to emphasize that
    files in the `lib` directory are designed to be included into 3rd party applications,
    while all other files, in `programs`, `tests` or `examples`,
    are intended to be used "as is", as part of their intended scenarios,
    with no intention to support 3rd party integration use cases.
