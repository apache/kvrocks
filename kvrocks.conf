# By default kvrocks listens for connections from localhost interface.
# It is possible to listen to just one or multiple interfaces using
# the "bind" configuration directive, followed by one or more IP addresses.
#
# Examples:
#
# bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1
# bind 127.0.0.1 ::1
bind 0.0.0.0

# Unix socket.
#
# Specify the path for the unix socket that will be used to listen for
# incoming connections. There is no default, so kvrocks will not listen
# on a unix socket when not specified.
#
# unixsocket /tmp/kvrocks.sock
# unixsocketperm 777

# Accept connections on the specified port, default is 6666.
port 6666

# Close the connection after a client is idle for N seconds (0 to disable)
timeout 0

# The number of worker's threads, increase or decrease would affect the performance.
workers 8

# By default, kvrocks does not run as a daemon. Use 'yes' if you need it.
# Note that kvrocks will write a PID file in /var/run/kvrocks.pid when daemonized
daemonize no

# Kvrocks implements the cluster solution that is similar to the Redis cluster solution.
# You can get cluster information by CLUSTER NODES|SLOTS|INFO command, it also is
# adapted to redis-cli, redis-benchmark, Redis cluster SDK, and Redis cluster proxy.
# But kvrocks doesn't support communicating with each other, so you must set
# cluster topology by CLUSTER SETNODES|SETNODEID commands, more details: #219.
#
# PLEASE NOTE:
# If you enable cluster, kvrocks will encode key with its slot id calculated by
# CRC16 and modulo 16384, encoding key with its slot id makes it efficient to
# migrate keys based on the slot. So if you enabled at first time, cluster mode must
# not be disabled after restarting, and vice versa. That is to say, data is not
# compatible between standalone mode with cluster mode, you must migrate data
# if you want to change mode, otherwise, kvrocks will make data corrupt.
#
# Default: no

cluster-enabled no


# Persist the cluster nodes topology in local file($dir/nodes.conf). This configuration
# takes effect only if the cluster mode was enabled.
#
# If yes, it will try to load the cluster topology from the local file when starting,
# and dump the cluster nodes into the file if it was changed.
#
# Default: yes
# persist-cluster-nodes-enabled yes

# Set the max number of connected clients at the same time. By default
# this limit is set to 10000 clients. However, if the server is not
# able to configure the process file limit to allow for the specified limit
# the max number of allowed clients is set to the current file limit
#
# Once the limit is reached the server will close all the new connections sending
# an error 'max number of clients reached'.
#
maxclients 10000

# Require clients to issue AUTH <PASSWORD> before processing any other
# commands.  This might be useful in environments in which you do not trust
# others with access to the host running kvrocks.
#
# This should stay commented out for backward compatibility and because most
# people do not need auth (e.g. they run their own servers).
#
# Warning: since kvrocks is pretty fast an outside user can try up to
# 150k passwords per second against a good box. This means that you should
# use a very strong password otherwise it will be very easy to break.
#
# requirepass foobared

# If the master is password protected (using the "masterauth" configuration
# directive below) it is possible to tell the slave to authenticate before
# starting the replication synchronization process. Otherwise, the master will
# refuse the slave request.
#
# masterauth foobared

# Master-Salve replication would check db name is matched. if not, the slave should
# refuse to sync the db from master. Don't use the default value, set the db-name to identify
# the cluster.

# The working directory
#
# The DB will be written inside this directory
# Note that you must specify a directory here, not a file name.
dir /tmp/kvrocks

# You can configure where to store your server logs by the log-dir.
# If you don't specify one, we will use the above `dir` as our default log directory.
# We also can send logs to stdout/stderr is as simple as:
#
log-dir stdout

# Log level
# Possible values: info, warning, error, fatal
# Default: info
log-level info

# You can configure log-retention-days to control whether to enable the log cleaner
# and the maximum retention days that the INFO level logs will be kept.
#
# if set to -1, that means to disable the log cleaner.
# if set to 0, all previous INFO level logs will be immediately removed.
# if set to between 0 to INT_MAX, that means it will retent latest N(log-retention-days) day logs.

# By default the log-retention-days is -1.
log-retention-days -1

# When running in daemonize mode, kvrocks writes a PID file in ${CONFIG_DIR}/kvrocks.pid by
# default. You can specify a custom pid file location here.
# pidfile /var/run/kvrocks.pid
pidfile ""

# You can configure a slave instance to accept writes or not. Writing against
# a slave instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data
# written on a slave will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but
# may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a
# misconfiguration.
slave-read-only yes

# The slave priority is an integer number published by Kvrocks in the INFO output.
# It is used by Redis Sentinel in order to select a slave to promote into a
# master if the master is no longer working correctly.
#
# A slave with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so
# for instance if there are three slave with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel will
# pick the one with priority 10, that is the lowest.
#
# However a special priority of 0 marks the replica as not able to perform the
# role of master, so a slave with priority of 0 will never be selected by
# Redis Sentinel for promotion.
#
# By default the priority is 100.
slave-priority 100

# TCP listen() backlog.
#
# In high requests-per-second environments you need an high backlog in order
# to avoid slow clients connections issues. Note that the Linux kernel
# will silently truncate it to the value of /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn so
# make sure to raise both the value of somaxconn and tcp_max_syn_backlog
# in order to Get the desired effect.
tcp-backlog 511

# If the master is an old version, it may have specified replication threads
# that use 'port + 1' as listening port, but in new versions, we don't use
# extra port to implement replication. In order to allow the new replicas to
# copy old masters, you should indicate that the master uses replication port
# or not.
# If yes, that indicates master uses replication port and replicas will connect
# to 'master's listening port + 1' when synchronization.
# If no, that indicates master doesn't use replication port and replicas will
# connect 'master's listening port' when synchronization.
master-use-repl-port no

# Currently, master only checks sequence number when replica asks for PSYNC,
# that is not enough since they may have different replication histories even
# the replica asking sequence is in the range of the master current WAL.
#
# We design 'Replication Sequence ID' PSYNC, we add unique replication id for
# every write batch (the operation of each command on the storage engine), so
# the combination of replication id and sequence is unique for write batch.
# The master can identify whether the replica has the same replication history
# by checking replication id and sequence.
#
# By default, it is not enabled since this stricter check may easily lead to
# full synchronization.
use-rsid-psync no

# Master-Slave replication. Use slaveof to make a kvrocks instance a copy of
# another kvrocks server. A few things to understand ASAP about kvrocks replication.
#
# 1) Kvrocks replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to
#    stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least
#    a given number of slaves.
# 2) Kvrocks slaves are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the
#    master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of
#    time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next
#    sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.
# 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a
#    network partition slaves automatically try to reconnect to masters
#    and resynchronize with them.
#
# slaveof <masterip> <masterport>
# slaveof 127.0.0.1 6379

# When a slave loses its connection with the master, or when the replication
# is still in progress, the slave can act in two different ways:
#
# 1) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the slave will
#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out-of-date data, or the
#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.
#
# 2) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the slave will reply with
#    an error "SYNC with master in progress" to all kinds of commands
#    but to INFO and SLAVEOF.
#
slave-serve-stale-data yes

# To guarantee slave's data safe and serve when it is in full synchronization
# state, slave still keep itself data. But this way needs to occupy much disk
# space, so we provide a way to reduce disk occupation, slave will delete itself
# entire database before fetching files from master during full synchronization.
# If you want to enable this way, you can set 'slave-delete-db-before-fullsync'
# to yes, but you must know that database will be lost if master is down during
# full synchronization, unless you have a backup of database.
#
# This option is similar redis replicas RDB diskless load option:
#       repl-diskless-load on-empty-db
#
# Default: no
slave-empty-db-before-fullsync no

# A Kvrocks master is able to list the address and port of the attached
# replicas in different ways. For example the "INFO replication" section
# offers this information, which is used, among other tools, by
# Redis Sentinel in order to discover replica instances.
# Another place where this info is available is in the output of the
# "ROLE" command of a master.
#
# The listed IP address and port normally reported by a replica is
# obtained in the following way:
#
#   IP: The address is auto detected by checking the peer address
#   of the socket used by the replica to connect with the master.
#
#   Port: The port is communicated by the replica during the replication
#   handshake, and is normally the port that the replica is using to
#   listen for connections.
#
# However when port forwarding or Network Address Translation (NAT) is
# used, the replica may actually be reachable via different IP and port
# pairs. The following two options can be used by a replica in order to
# report to its master a specific set of IP and port, so that both INFO
# and ROLE will report those values.
#
# There is no need to use both the options if you need to override just
# the port or the IP address.
#
# replica-announce-ip 5.5.5.5
# replica-announce-port 1234

# If replicas need full synchronization with master, master need to create
# checkpoint for feeding replicas, and replicas also stage a checkpoint of
# the master. If we also keep the backup, it maybe occupy extra disk space.
# You can enable 'purge-backup-on-fullsync' if disk is not sufficient, but
# that may cause remote backup copy failing.
#
# Default: no
purge-backup-on-fullsync no

# The maximum allowed rate (in MB/s) that should be used by replication.
# If the rate exceeds max-replication-mb, replication will slow down.
# Default: 0 (i.e. no limit)

#
# tls-ca-cert-file ca.crt
# tls-ca-cert-dir /etc/ssl/certs

# By default, clients on a TLS port are required

################################## SLOW LOG ###################################

# The Kvrocks Slow Log is a mechanism to log queries that exceeded a specified
# execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations
# like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,
# but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only
# stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve
# other requests in the meantime).
#
# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Kvrocks
# what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the
# command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the
# slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the
# queue of logged commands.

# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent
# to one second. Note that -1 value disables the slow log, while
# a value of zero forces the logging of every command.
slowlog-log-slower-than 100000

# There is no limit to this length. Just be aware that it will consume memory.
# You can reclaim memory used by the slow log with SLOWLOG RESET.
slowlog-max-len 128

# If you run kvrocks from upstart or systemd, kvrocks can interact with your
# supervision tree. Options:
#   supervised no      - no supervision interaction
#   supervised upstart - signal upstart by putting kvrocks into SIGSTOP mode
#   supervised systemd - signal systemd by writing READY=1 to $NOTIFY_SOCKET
#   supervised auto    - detect upstart or systemd method based on
#                        UPSTART_JOB or NOTIFY_SOCKET environment variables
# Note: these supervision methods only signal "process is ready."
#       They do not enable continuous liveness pings back to your supervisor.

################################## PERF LOG ###################################

# The Kvrocks Perf Log is a mechanism to log queries' performance context that
# exceeded a specified execution time. This mechanism uses rocksdb's
# Perf Context and IO Stats Context, Please see:
# https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Perf-Context-and-IO-Stats-Context
#
# This mechanism is enabled when profiling-sample-commands is not empty and
# profiling-sample-ratio greater than 0.
# It is important to note that this mechanism affects performance, but it is
# useful for troubleshooting performance bottlenecks, so it should only be
# enabled when performance problems occur.

# The name of the commands you want to record. Must be original name of
# commands supported by Kvrocks. Use ',' to separate multiple commands and
# use '*' to record all commands supported by Kvrocks.
# Example:
#   - Single command: profiling-sample-commands get
#   - Multiple commands: profiling-sample-commands get,mget,hget
#
# Default: empty
# profiling-sample-commands ""

# Ratio of the samples would be recorded. It is a number between 0 and 100.
# We simply use the rand to determine whether to record the sample or not.
#
# Default: 0
profiling-sample-ratio 0

# There is no limit to this length. Just be aware that it will consume memory.
# You can reclaim memory used by the perf log with PERFLOG RESET.
#
# Default: 256

# However, if a specific SST file was created more than "force-compact-file-age" seconds 
# ago, and its percentage of deleted keys is higher than 
# "force-compact-file-min-deleted-percentage", it will be forcely compacted as well.

# Default: 172800 seconds; Range: [60, INT64_MAX];

# Command renaming.
#
# It is possible to change the name of dangerous commands in a shared
# environment. For instance, the KEYS command may be renamed into something
# hard to guess so that it will still be available for internal-use tools
# but not available for general clients.
#
# Example:
#
# rename-command KEYS b840fc02d524045429941cc15f59e41cb7be6c52
#
# It is also possible to completely kill a command by renaming it into
# an empty string:
#
# rename-command KEYS ""

# BlobDB(key-value separation) is essentially RocksDB for large-value use cases.
# Since 6.18.0, The new implementation is integrated into the RocksDB core.
# When set, large values (blobs) are written to separate blob files, and only
# pointers to them are stored in SST files. This can reduce write amplification
# for large-value use cases at the cost of introducing a level of indirection
# for reads. Please see: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/BlobDB.
#
# Note that when enable_blob_files is set to yes, BlobDB-related configuration
# items will take effect.
#
# Default: no
rocksdb.enable_blob_files no

# The size of the smallest value to be stored separately in a blob file. Values
# which have an uncompressed size smaller than this threshold are stored alongside
# the keys in SST files in the usual fashion.
#
# Default: 4096 byte, 0 means that all values are stored in blob files
rocksdb.min_blob_size 4096

# The size limit for blob files. When writing blob files, a new file is
# opened once this limit is reached.

# Default: 268435456 bytes
rocksdb.blob_file_size 268435456

# Enables garbage collection of blobs. Valid blobs residing in blob files
# older than a cutoff get relocated to new files as they are encountered
# during compaction, which makes it possible to clean up blob files once
# they contain nothing but obsolete/garbage blobs.
# See also rocksdb.blob_garbage_collection_age_cutoff below.
#
# Default: yes
rocksdb.enable_blob_garbage_collection yes

# The percentage cutoff in terms of blob file age for garbage collection.
# Blobs in the oldest N blob files will be relocated when encountered during
# compaction, where N = (garbage_collection_cutoff/100) * number_of_blob_files.

# The purpose of the following three options are to dynamically adjust the upper limit of
# the data that each layer can store according to the size of the different
# layers of the LSM. Enabling this option will bring some improvements in
# deletion efficiency and space amplification, but it will lose a certain
# amount of read performance.
# If you want to know more details about Levels' Target Size, you can read RocksDB wiki:
# https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Leveled-Compaction#levels-target-size

# Default: 268435456 bytes
rocksdb.max_bytes_for_level_base 268435456

# Multiplication factor for the total file size of L(n+1) layers.
# This option is a double type number in RocksDB, but kvrocks is
# not support the double data type number yet, so we use integer
# number instead of double currently.

# This feature only takes effect in Iterators and MultiGet.
# If yes, RocksDB will try to read asynchronously and in parallel as much as possible to hide IO latency.
# In iterators, it will prefetch data asynchronously in the background for each file being iterated on. 
# In MultiGet, it will read the necessary data blocks from those files in parallel as much as possible.

# Default no
rocksdb.read_options.async_io no

# If yes, the write will be flushed from the operating system
# buffer cache before the write is considered complete.
# If this flag is enabled, writes will be slower.
# If this flag is disabled, and the machine crashes, some recent
# rites may be lost.  Note that if it is just the process that
# crashes (i.e., the machine does not reboot), no writes will be
# lost even if sync==false.
#
# Default: no
rocksdb.write_options.sync no

# If yes, writes will not first go to the write ahead log,
# and the write may get lost after a crash.

#
# Default: no
rocksdb.write_options.no_slowdown no

# If enabled, write requests are of lower priority if compaction is
# behind. In this case, no_slowdown = true, the request will be canceled
# immediately. Otherwise, it will be slowed down.
# The slowdown value is determined by RocksDB to guarantee
# it introduces minimum impacts to high priority writes.
#
# Default: no
rocksdb.write_options.low_pri no

# If enabled, this writebatch will maintain the last insert positions of each
# memtable as hints in concurrent write. It can improve write performance
# in concurrent writes if keys in one writebatch are sequential.
