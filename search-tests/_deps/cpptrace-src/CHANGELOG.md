# v0.8.0

Added:
- Added support for resolving symbols from elf and mach-o symbol tables, allowing function names to be resolved even in
  a build that doesn't include debug information https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/201
- Added a configurable stack trace formatter https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/164
- Added configuration options for the libdwarf back-end that can be used to lower memory usage on memory-constrained
  systems https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/193
- Added `cpptrace::nullable<T>::null_value`
- Made `cpptrace::nullable<T>` member functions conditionally `constexpr` where possible

Fixed:
- Fixed handling of `SymInitialize` when other code has already called `SymInitialize`. `SymInitialize` must only be
  called once per handle and cpptrace now attempts to duplicate the current process handle to avoid conflicts.
  https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/204
- Fixed a couple of locking edge cases surrounding dbghelp functions
- Fixed improper deallocation of `dwarf_errmsg` in the libdwarf back-end

Breaking changes:
- `cpptrace::get_snippet` previously included a newline at the end but it now does not. This also affects the behavior
  of trace formatting with snippets enabled.

Other:
- Significantly improved memory usage and performance of the libdwarf back-end
- Improved implementation and organization of internal utility types, such as `optional` and `Result`
- Improved trace printing and formatting implementation
- Added unit tests for library internal utilities
- Added logic to the cxxabi demangler to ensure external names begin with `_Z` or `__Z` before attempting to demangle
- Added various internal tools and abstractions to improve maintainability and clarity
- Various internal improvements for robustness
- Added a small handful of utility tool programs that are useful for continued development, maintenance, and debugging
- Improved library CI setup
- Marked the `CPPTRACE_BUILD_BENCHMARK` option as advanced
